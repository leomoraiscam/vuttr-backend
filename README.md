## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

API and database for the VUTTR (Very Useful Tools to Remember) application. The application is a repository to manage tools with their respective names, links, descriptions and tags.


Created with requirements based on the challenge of [Bossa Box](https://app.bossabox.com/).

## 🏁 Getting started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

###  Application Routes

- **`POST /tools`**: Route to register a new tool. The request body must contain the information of the tool to be registered, without the ID (automatically generated by the server).

- **`GET /tools`**: Route to list all registered tools.

- **`GET /tools?tag={tag}`**: Route to list tools using a tag search, that is, filtering tools according to the received tag.

- **`DELETE /tools/{id}`**: Route to delete a tool.

- **`GET /api-docs`**: Route with all API documentation.


## 🤔 how to contribute?

You can use this project, to scale the application that even with few routes, the use of SOLID made possible the evolution of the API in a much more accessible way.

### Requirements

Have at least one Node package manager installed, [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) ou [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Installing

Run the following command at the root of the project to install the dependencies `yarn install` ou `npm install`

To run the API locally, you must have a Postgress container with the correct name so that the typeorm can connect to your database.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leomoraiscam/vuttr-backend && cd vuttr-backend-main
```

**Follow the steps below**

```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ yarn
# Create and start containers of postgreSQL and redis using docker
$ docker-compose up -d
# Make a copy of 'ormconfig.example.json' to 'ormconfig.json'
# and set the values, if they are not filled,
# to connect with docker database containers
$ cp ormconfig.example.json ormconfig.json
# Once the services are running, run the migrations
$ yarn typeorm migration:run
# Well done, project is started!
$ yarn start:dev
```

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

```sh
yarn test
```

### About tests


For this application, I implemented the following tests:

- **`should be able to create a new tool`**: For this test to pass, the application must allow a tool to be created, and return a json with the tool created.

- **`should be able to list the tools`**: For this test to pass, the application must allow an array containing all the tools to be returned.

- **`should be able to list tools with tag filter`**: For this test to pass, your application must allow an object to be returned containing all the tools that contain the tag passed in the route.

- **`should be able to delete a tool`**: For this test to pass, the application must allow deleting a tool.

- **`should not be able to delete a nonexistent tool`**: For this test to pass, the application must not allow deleting a tool that does not exist.
